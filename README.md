# DeepLearning Lab with PyTorchðŸ”¥
This repository is my space to experiment with algorithms, models, and various deep learning techniques using PyTorch. From foundational concepts to advanced implementations, it's all about exploring and learning!

### Installation
1. Create a Virtual Environment
    ```bash
    python -m venv myenv
    ```
2. Activate the Environment
   - On Windows:
   ```bash
   myenv\Scripts\activate
   ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
   ```bash
   source myenv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Configure the kernel
   ```bash
   python -m ipykernel install --user --name=myenv --display-name "Python (myenv)"
   ```
5. Open Jupyter Notebook
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
6. Select the file you want to open and the correct kernel we set up from step 4
7. Experiment and Explore!
